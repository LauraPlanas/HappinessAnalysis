# HappinessAnalysis

This project is part of the Data Visualitzation subject from the Data Science Master's Degree from the Open University of Catalonia (UOC).

It consistis in a R Shiny application that uses merged data from the World Development Indicators dataset from the World Bank and a Happiness survey data from a Kaggle dataset. The goal of the visualitzation is to understand how the money (or the lack of it) can be related with the happiness of a country.

## Project structure
The code for this project is composed by the following directories and files:

* `/data`: directory where we can find the data sources we used for the visualization.
* `app.R`: file that contains the back-end and the front-end of the web application. We need to execute this file in order to run the application in a local environment.
* `data.R`: complementary file with some functions used to read and process the data before showing it in the visualizations.
